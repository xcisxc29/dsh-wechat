Control DeepSeek Harness from WeChat: chat on your phone, and the DSH agent on your computer does the
work.

No OpenClaw, and no public IP required.

**Runs on the current DSH desktop app** — developed and tested against DSH `0.2.0-rc.2`, and kept
current as the desktop app moves on. A lot of community plugins quietly stopped working when DSH
updated; this one is maintained alongside it, and every change is released through CI.

[中文说明](README.zh.md)

## Features

- **Text both ways.** Your WeChat message becomes a DSH prompt; the reply comes back to WeChat.
- **Photos, files, voice, video** — both directions. Attachments are saved into the session workspace
  and handed to the agent; the agent can send files back with `send_to_wechat`.
- **One WeChat chat, many DSH sessions.** `/new`, `/list`, `/switch`, `/current`, `/cancel` — or just
  say "switch to the other one".
- **Answer permission prompts from your phone.** Approvals and multiple-choice questions are sent to
  WeChat and answered with a number, so being away from the desk does not stall the agent.
- **Settings page** under **Settings → WeChat**.

## Install

**For the DSH desktop app.** It needs DSH's workspace, tool and UI services — the standard desktop
composition — on a machine that stays on. Tested against `0.2.0-rc.2`, and updated alongside the
desktop app.

Open the **plugin** entry in the sidebar and choose **添加插件** (add plugin). The field takes a package
name, a Git URL, a tarball, or a local path.

> ### The name to install is `dsh-wechat-plugin`
>
> The repository is called `dsh-wechat`, but the package is not: **copy `dsh-wechat-plugin` rather than
> typing it, and mind the `-plugin`.** The install command has to match the package name exactly.

<summary><b>From npm</b> — nothing to configure</summary>

dsh-wechat-plugin
```

Add a version if you need one: `dsh-wechat-plugin@0.36.1`.

<summary><b>From GitHub</b> — builds itself, for tracking a branch or a commit</summary>

```

```

DSH clones the repository and builds it. **pnpm will stop the build once and ask you to allow it** —
that is expected, and it is how any Git-hosted plugin builds. DSH reports which key to add; it looks
like this, in `~/.dsh/profiles/desktop/pnpm-workspace.yaml`:

```yaml
allowBuilds:
  dsh-wechat-workspace@git+file:///…/dsh-wechat#<commit>: true
```

Most people do not need this. Reach for it to pin a commit or follow a branch, or when npm is
unreachable.
</details>

Wait for the install to finish, click **立即启用** (enable now), and restart DSH.

<details>
<summary>Install from a terminal instead</summary>

The app drives `pnpm` underneath, so the same thing headlessly:

```bash
dsh plugin --profile desktop add dsh-wechat-plugin
dsh plugin --profile desktop add https://github.com/xcisxc29/dsh-wechat
```

You then have to enable the bundle yourself — which is what **立即启用** does for you — in
`~/.dsh/profiles/desktop/package.json`:

```json
{
  "dsh": {
    "profile": {
      "bundles": [
        "@deepseek-ai/dsh-base",
        "@deepseek-ai/dsh-web-app",
        "dsh-wechat-plugin"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```
</details>

<details>
<summary>Install from a locally built tarball</summary>

```bash
pnpm install && pnpm run dist && pnpm run pack
# → dsh-wechat-plugin-<version>.tgz
```

Paste the absolute path to that `.tgz` into **添加插件**, or hand it to the command line:

```bash
dsh plugin --profile desktop add /absolute/path/to/dsh-wechat-plugin-<version>.tgz
```
</details>

### Getting started

After restarting DSH, open **Settings → WeChat**, click **重新扫码** (rescan), and scan the QR code with
your phone. Send `你好` from WeChat and you should get a reply.

### Optional: voice to text

WeChat voice notes are SILK. Install this codec to transcribe them to WAV locally:

```bash
dsh plugin --profile desktop add silk-wasm
```

Without it voice still works: the raw SILK file is saved and handed to the agent along with the
service's own transcription.

## Usage

Just send a message and it reaches the agent:

```
你好
```

Type these to control which DSH conversation you are talking to:

| Command | What it does |
|---|---|
| `/new` | Start a fresh conversation. Anything after it becomes the title: `/new 修复登录` starts a conversation called 「修复登录」. Without one, the conversation gets a name from your first message |
| `/list` | Conversations in the WeChat workspace, newest first |
| `/list all` | Every conversation, including other workspaces |
| `/switch 3` | Move to number 3 in that list |
| `/current` | Which conversation you are in |
| `/cancel` | Stop the task that is running |
| `/help` | This list |

**Spaces are optional**: `/switch3`, `/switch 3` and `/switch:3` all work.

**Plain language works too** — "switch to the other one", "what conversations do I have", "stop". The
agent judges the intent rather than matching fixed rules, and a switch tells you whether it succeeded
or failed.

## Security

**Only you can reach it.** The channel talks to Tencent's official iLink gateway, and nothing else —
no third-party service, no self-hosted relay in the middle. When you scan the QR code, the bot is
**cryptographically bound to your WeChat account**: the token it receives embeds your `ilink_user_id`,
and the service only ever delivers messages from that one account. The bot is not a WeChat contact —
it has no shareable card, nothing searches for it, and nobody can add it. There is no "someone else
could message it" surface, which is why no allowlist exists: the protocol already is one.

Two things are still true and worth knowing:

**Conversations from WeChat run with full permissions by default** — the agent does not ask before it
acts. That is deliberate: a permission prompt is delivered to WeChat and the task then waits there, so
on a phone every command would stall until you answered a conversation you had walked away from. Set
**Permissions for WeChat conversations** to `Follow the DSH setting` in the settings page if you want
the same guardrails you have at the desk.

**The agent runs as you.** It can execute commands and read and write files, with your user's
permissions — that is what it is for, and it means anything you can do on this machine, it can do.
So: skim what you asked for before walking away, and **lock the screen** when you leave. Locking does
not stop the agent (see the user guide), and it keeps anyone passing by out of your desktop.

**Any session on this machine can push to your WeChat by default.** That is what makes "tell me when it
is done" work: the session doing the work is usually not the one your WeChat conversation is bound to,
and without this it could not report its own result. Turn off **Let other sessions push to WeChat** to
restore the stricter rule, where only the bound session may send.

## Development

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm build              # compiles only, leaving @dsh-wechat/core imports for pack to rewrite
pnpm run dist           # build + inline core: the loadable form a Git install needs
pnpm typecheck
pnpm test               # 194 tests
pnpm check              # build + typecheck + test
pnpm run pack           # run dist first
pnpm run verify-pack    # unpack, check the manifest's files, mount it as DSH would
```

Two build outputs, on purpose. `build` is the compiling step alone, and it keeps
`@dsh-wechat/core` as a package import so `pack` can redirect it into the vendored `dist/core`.
`dist` runs that compile and then rewrites the import to a relative path instead, which is what a Git
install ends up with — it clones the repository and runs `prepare`, never `pack`.

**Rebuild `core` after changing it.** Tests resolve `@dsh-wechat/core` through `node_modules` to
`lib/`, so source edits without a rebuild test the *old* code — and pass.
