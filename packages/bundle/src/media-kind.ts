/**
 * How an outbound attachment is classified for the WeChat service.
 *
 * The service keeps its objects apart by kind: an image, a video, and a generic file are
 * uploaded under different media types and announced with different message items. Getting
 * the kind wrong is not cosmetic — a video uploaded as a file arrives as an opaque download
 * instead of a playable clip.
 *
 * This lives on its own so the mapping can be tested without standing up the whole send path.
